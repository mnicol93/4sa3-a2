# Assignment #2 Factory Pattern Starter Code
#
# Starter code for Assignment #2...
#
# The Open Weather Map API allows to to request the weather for a given city:
#   - Documentation: https://openweathermap.org/api
# In order to use this API, we do need to create an account to obtain an API
# key: https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_in.  And it does take a few
# minutes for the API key to start working after we've signed up for it...
#
# This API also has a "wrapper", a Python module that makes accessing the API
# easier for us... rather than manually making and sending requests, we
# can call functions that do this for us and just return the results.
#  - Wrapper documentation: https://github.com/csparpa/pyowm
#
# See the WebAPI Examples on Avenue for an example of using this wrapper!
#
# To install a Python module locally to make it available in your own solutions,
# you generally need to use pip3:
#    pip3 install pylast
#

# import the open weather data wrapper module

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Implement these classes: Factory, WeatherData, Wind, Humidity, Temperature

              " m/s in " + self.location)

# Create factory object
factory = Factory()

# Create a WeatherData object of each type (Wind, Temperature, Humidity) at
# different locations so we can test our factory's createData instance method
weatherdata = [factory.createData("Hamilton,ON,CA", "wind"),
               factory.createData("Toronto,ON,CA", "humidity"),
               factory.createData("Ottawa,ON,CA", "temperature")]

# Call the output method for each WeatherData object
for data in weatherdata:
    data.output()

# When I run the above code with my factory object and WeatherData objects
# implemented, I get the following:
#
#   Wind speed of 6.7 meter/sec in Hamilton,ON,CA
#   Humidity of 35% in Toronto,ON,CA
#   Temperature of 30.71C in Ottawa,ON,CA
